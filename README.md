# whiskey_rec_app
This app takes the information from the clustering analysis and uses it to provide recommendations based on user input.

Goal: The goal is to have a web application that is capable of taking user input (e.g. search input) and executing a query to find or filter whiskeys based on that. 
Once the person has found the whiskey they are looking for, they should be able to interact with a control which will bring up whiskeys with similar reviews. An idea 
for how to do this would be to populate a large table with whiskeys, use input to filter them and then allow a button click to pull up the cluster for that whiskey.
